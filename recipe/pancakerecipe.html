      <h1>Dutch oven pancakes with fresh strawberries</h1>
      <p>These pancakes look very impressive and are deceptively easy to make although you do need a blender. Dutch oven pancakes differ from regular pancakes in that you bake your batter and, in the process, they puff up huge like a soufflé. You end up with a sweet and salty, crispy yet chewy, airy pillow. This recipe calls for making small cups by using a muffin pan, but you can also make one giant pancake by baking the batter in a cast iron skillet.

      <h2>Equipment</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Blender (you can mix by hand in a bowl if you don't have a blender)</li>
      <li>Muffin pan or cast iron skillet</li>
    </ul>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>3 large eggs (or 4 medium)</li>
      <li>3/4 cups of milk</li>
      <li>3/4 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>Fresh strawberries, thoroughly washed</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Maple syrup</li>
    </ul>
      
      <h2>Cooking Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F</li>
    <li>Put the eggs into a blender and blend for about 30 seconds.</li>
    <li>Add the milk and blend together.</li>
    <li>Add the flour and salt and blend on high until mixed and frothy.</li>
    <li>Let the batter rest for a few minutes.</li>
    <li>Put a small piece of butter in the bottom of each muffin cup and place in the oven.</li>
    <li>When the butter has melted and just starts to foam*, remove the muffin pan from the oven and fill each muffin cup about 2/3 full with pancake batter. *The butter needs to be at the point of foaming. This indicates the pan is hot enough. If it's too cool, then the pancakes won't rise.</li>
    <li>Return the pan to the oven and bake for about 12-15 minutes or until they are puffed up and golden. If making a single pancake in a cast iron skillet it may 20-25 minutes to turn golden brown.</li>
